        "In the previous classes we saw that one could replace the model-based value iteration process by an approximate value iteration one. When the approximation is done by performing stochastic approximation, we obtain the $Q$ learning algorithm. We saw it was straightforward to extend this to use experience replay memories and batch stochastic gradient descent. In this class, we combine the stochastic gradient descent approach with replay memories and represent $Q$ as a neural network. This yields the Deep Q-Networks algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are few new concepts in this class compared to previous ones. Mainly, what we do is bring neural networks into the framework we have previously built. Therefore, this class is aimed at more practice. For this purpose, we start by introducing a set of [environments](#sec1) to illustrate further developments. Then we will start from Value Iteration and repeat the thought process of the previous classes, introduce [stochastic gradient descent](#sec2), [experience replay](#sec3) and reach the [DQN algorithm](#sec4). The end of the class is an [open challenge](#challenge) on several difficult benchmarks.\n",

        "> The idea that we learn by interacting with our environment is probably the first to occur to us when we think about the nature of learning. When an infant plays, waves its arms, or looks about, it has no explicit teacher, but it does have a direct sensorimotor connection to its environment. Exercising this connection produces a wealth of information about cause and effect, about the consequences of actions, and about what to do in order to achieve goals. Throughout our lives, such interactions are undoubtedly a major source of knowledge about our environment and ourselves. Whether we are learning to drive a car or to hold a conversation, we are acutely aware of how our environment responds to what we do, and we seek to influence what happens through our behavior. Learning from interaction is a foundational idea underlying nearly all theories of learning and intelligence. (Richard S. Sutton)"

That's a little too many for an efficient enumeration. Of course, most of the possible images will never occur in a Breakout game and the true state space is actually a much smaller subset of the full set of possible images.

This is not such an uncommon trick, it actually amounts to using an L2 loss for values of the loss between $-1$ and $1$ and an L1 loss outside of this domain. This is also know as the [Huber Loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss) or the [smooth L1 loss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#smoothl1loss)."
